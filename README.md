### About Yarn's Story:
Once upon a time, there is a naughty dog named Yarn. He loves finding balls in his cozy home and hates dog bomb.

+ When Yarn hits a ball, player gets 10 scores and another ball is created randomly in the room.
+ When Yarn hits a bomb, player gets -10 scores and Yarnâ€™s speed get increased and another Bomb is created randomly in the room.
+ Magic States (SPEEDUP, SPEEDDOWN, INVINCIBLE) are ramdomly attached to ball and bomb, which cause temporary state change on Yarn for 2 seconds. 
+ Current Speed, Score and MagicState are updated and displayed on stop of screen.
+ There are walls/obstacle in the room. When Yarn hits a wall or the border of the room, game ends.
+ Player are able to add his/her name into leader board, and choose to replay or finish the game.
