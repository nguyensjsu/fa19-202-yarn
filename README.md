### About Yarn's Story:
Once upon a time, there is a naughty dog named Yarn. He loves finding balls in his cozy home and hates dog bomb.

+ When Yarn hits a ball, player gets **10** scores and another ball is created randomly in the room.
+ When Yarn hits a bomb, player gets **-10** scores and Yarnâ€™s speed get increased and another Bomb is created randomly in the room.
+ Magic States (```SPEEDUP```, ```SPEEDDOWN```, ```INVINCIBLE```) are randomly attached to ball and bomb, which cause temporary state change on Yarn **for 2 seconds**. 
+ There are walls/obstacle in the room. When Yarn hits a wall or the border of the room, game ends.

### Key Design Features:

#### Decorator Pattern

#### State Pattern

State Pattern is used to allow an Dog(Yarn) Object to alter its behavior when its magic state changes.The state transition is triggered by either touching a PowerUp (ball/bomb) with Magic State or timer (reset State).
